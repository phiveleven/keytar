Keytar
======

* is a jQuery plugin to provide keyboard shortcuts and interface hints for them 
so you can party like it's 2013
* is in active development as of July 2013
* has no roadmap
* has [issues](https://github.com/phiveleven/keytar/issues)

For a related non-plugin, take a look at [mousetrap](https://github.com/ccampbell/mousetrap) too.
This project intends to extend mousetrap functionality (not copy or replace it).

Features
========
* <code> $(selector).keytar( keyCode, fn ) </code>

future:
* when active, 
    it can (visually) suggest options to help in API discoverability
* when an option is selected, 
    it performs a (visual) macro showing the necessary keystrokes or gestures
